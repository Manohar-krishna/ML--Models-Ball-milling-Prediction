# ML--Models-Ball-milling-Prediction
The core goal of this project is to develop a predictive machine learning (ML) model that establishes a quantitative relationship between the controllable process parameters of high-energy ball milling and the resulting physical characteristics of the synthesized gamma titanium aluminide (Î³-TiAl) powder.
